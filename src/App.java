/*
This code consists of a password manager application that works through a Command Line Interface.
This project was started on 11/18 at 2:10 AM. It was being developed because I was simply saving my passwords in a .txt file.
It wasn't organized no matter how hard we tried. With this application, the organization will be much better.

Starting Date: 11/18/2025 - Finish Date: "ongoing"
